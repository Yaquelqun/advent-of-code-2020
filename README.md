# AdventOfCode2020
Welcome, welcome to my solution repo for the riddles of the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2020), 2020 edition

The goal of the entire project is to try out a more Object Oriented way of coding and try - by adding heavy constraints to the way I usually code - to come up with a more elegant/efficient way of programming.

# Rules
- All riddles should be solved inside of the application
- I should only have to launch one line and then interact with the application (as if i ran a rails s)
- Rubocop TO THE MAX (i set up rubocop and changed NOTHING)
- Try to be [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) as much as my understanding of the SOLID principle allows me to be.
- Follow Sandi Metz [5 rules for OOP](https://yiming.dev/blog/2017/08/23/sandi-metzs-rules-for-oop/) or at least the ones that are applicable to a pure Ruby application

# TODO
- [ ] finish all riddles
- [ ] add at least simple tests for each riddle 
- [ ] add unit tests to each class using stub/mocking
- [ ] keep on refactoring to make the code separated
